Blog Agent 1 — "Top Questions" agent (Al Haya Sofa Care).

Researches what real questions UAE/Dubai people are asking RIGHT NOW about a
service category we offer (e.g. sofa shampooing, leather cleaning, stain
removal — the general industry topic, never the "Al Haya Sofa Care" brand
itself), and what the best answers currently look like out there. Turns the
most unique/powerful question+answer into an original blog post published
under Al Haya Sofa Care's own name.
